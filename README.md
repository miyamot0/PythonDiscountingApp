# Python Discounting App
This project provides the basis for running local or remote curve fitting sessions with python.  The code here was tested on windows, mac and linux distributions for both client and server-based purposes.

The current process uses a an API to enable statistical operations by a simple webapp, enabling browsers and other mobile applications to perform calculations if they cannot access a python interpreter locally or compile SciPy binaries (e.g., fortran extensions, etc.).

Communication with the server (once vetted and secured, of course), allows curl-based communication between your current pages/server and the flask service.
